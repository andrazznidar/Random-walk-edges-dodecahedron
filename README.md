# Random-walk-edges-dodecahedron
Calculate the expected number of random moves along the edges of a dodecahedron to get to the opposite vertex.

# Usage
1. Install Julia high-level programming language.
2. Download the file `Random-walk-edges-dodecahedron.jl` from this repository.
3. Run `julia Random-walk-edges-dodecahedron.jl` from the command line.
4. Observe the result **35**.

# Details
The vertices are numbered from top to bottom, from left to right, in this orthogonal projection of a dodecahedron:
